Walmart Sales Forecasting And Demand Analysis
Below is a step-by-step outline we follow in our Jupyter Notebook to perform "Walmart Sales Forecasting And Demand Analysis" using Python:

### 1. Data Import and Initial Inspection

Load the dataset (e.g., CSV file) into a Pandas DataFrame.
Examine the structure of the data (using methods like .head(), .info(), and .describe()) to understand the fields and their types.
### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Convert the Date field into a datetime format.
Check for missing values or inconsistencies and handle them appropriately.
Ensure that categorical fields (like Holiday_Flag) are correctly formatted.
If necessary, parse and encode holiday events information for later use.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### 3.1 Demand Forecasting

Use historical weekly sales data to predict future demand.

### 3.2 Time Series Analysis

Analyze trends, seasonality, and cyclical patterns using the Date and Weekly_Sales fields.

### 3.3 Historical Data Analysis

Explore past performance, trends, and sales patterns over the given time period.

### 3.4 Seasonal Variation Analysis

Identify and model seasonal trends, particularly by comparing holiday weeks (using Holiday_Flag and known holiday dates) against non-holiday periods.

### 3.5 External Factors Analysis

Study the influence of external variables like Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, and Unemployment on sales.


Apply these techniques to smooth the data and generate forecasts.
Error Measurement

Evaluate forecasting models using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, etc.

### 3.6 Incorporating Qualitative Data Alongside Quantitative Data (Limited)

Integrate qualitative insights such as holiday events (via Holiday_Flag and known holiday dates) with quantitative sales figures.
Plot Weekly_Sales over time to observe overall trends, seasonality, and any anomalies.
Visualize distributions and summary statistics for numeric features (Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, Unemployment).
Analyze the correlation between Weekly_Sales and the external factors.
Identify the impact of holiday weeks by comparing sales during holiday and non-holiday periods.
### 4. Feature Engineering

Create time-based features from the Date (e.g., year, month, week, day of the week).
Generate lag features and rolling statistics (e.g., moving averages) for Weekly_Sales to capture temporal dependencies.
Encode holiday events or flags as additional features if they can influence demand patterns.
### 6. Time Series Preparation

Set the Date as the DataFrame index to treat the data as a time series.
Resample or aggregate data if needed (for example, to ensure consistent time intervals).
Check for stationarity and apply transformations or differencing if required.
### 7. Model Selection and Forecasting Approach

Choose appropriate forecasting models such as ARIMA/SARIMA, Facebook Prophet, or machine learning methods that handle time series data.
Decide whether to include exogenous variables (like Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, Unemployment) to improve the forecasting accuracy.
### 8. Model Training and Evaluation

Split the data into training and test sets (or use time-based cross-validation).
Train your chosen forecasting model(s) on the training data.
Evaluate model performance using error metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
### 9. Forecast Generation and Demand Analysis

Generate future sales forecasts using the trained model.
Compare forecasted values with historical data to validate model performance.
Analyze the forecast to identify demand patterns, seasonal trends, and the influence of external factors.

### 9. Regression Analysis

Investigate relationships between Weekly_Sales and external factors using linear regression or other methods.
Forecasting Methods (Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing)
### 10. Visualization and Reporting

Create visualizations (line plots, bar charts, etc.) to compare actual vs. forecasted sales.
Develop dashboards or reports summarizing key insights, trends, and recommendations for demand planning.
### 11. Conclusion and Future Enhancements

Summarize the findings and discuss the impact of various features on sales.
Outline potential future steps, such as integrating more data sources, refining feature engineering, or testing additional models for improved accuracy.
